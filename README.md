# repro-examples
The placenta groups collection of model demonstrations using our own, and other in house python libraries. This repository is private to the group during development with the anticipation that relevant examples will be released publicly.

Documentation is available at `Read the docs <https://placenta-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


To start working with these examples just clone these repositories to your computer.

The 'documentation' folder of this set of examples contains sphinx documentation. You can build this documentation by navigating to the documentation folder and executing commands to build the documentation in whatever format you like (for example, make html).
